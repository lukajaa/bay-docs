# Vue and Nuxt

Bay Clock 3 is built upon VueJS, a progressive javascript framework that builds on basic HTML, JS, and CSS to add reactivity and a more powerful developer experience. Nuxt, in turn, is a VueJS framework that streamlines development, SEO, and deployment

An understanding of HTML, javascript, and JSON is required. I will try to explain each component, page, and function pretty in-depth. However, I reccomend learning the basics of both [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) (and the composition API) as well as [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/).
